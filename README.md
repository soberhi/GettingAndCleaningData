Getting And Cleaning Data - Assignment

I have two files:

(1) My code - entitled: run_analysis.R
    This is the file with the source code behind all the data tidying and clean-up.

(2) A code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformation work.

To create the tidy data set, just run the source code. It will create the interm data sets and tidy it up, before creating the finished poduct.
