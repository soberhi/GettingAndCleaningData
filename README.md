Getting And Cleaning Data - Assignment

I have two files:

(1) My code - entitled: run_analysis.R
    This is the file with the source code behind all the data tidying and clean-up.

(2) A code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformation work.

To create the tidy data set, just run the source code. It will create the interm data sets and tidy it up, before creating the finished poduct.

Steps involved in my analysis:

STEP ONE: I merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.

STEP TWO : I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

STEP THREE: I used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

STEP FOUR: I used labels for the data set with descriptive variable names.

STEP FIVE: I created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
