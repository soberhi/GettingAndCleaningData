Describe the data:

The data came from experiments that were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The test and training data was then combined and then the average calculated for each variable by activity and person.

Steps involved:

STEP ONE: I merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.

STEP TWO : I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

STEP THREE: I used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

STEP FOUR: I used labels for the data set with descriptive variable names.

STEP FIVE: I created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
